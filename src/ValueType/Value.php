/**

 * of a property (DATE-TIME, DURATION, TEXT, INTEGER, …), including the
 * property-value enums (EventStatus, Transparency, …).
 *
 * `toString()` returns the *logical* value; wire-level escaping (for TEXT) and
 * folding are applied by the serializer, except for {@see RawValue}, which is
 * emitted verbatim to preserve unmodelled input (Level-1 round-trip).
 *
 * Note: this interface intentionally does not extend Stringable — enums cannot
 * declare __toString, and they need to implement Value.
